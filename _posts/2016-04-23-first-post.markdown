My company, Hellman Software, is registered and my last working day at Bontouch is Wednesday next week. Starting in May, I will be working as a freelance consultant. I will mostly focus on Android development, but I have a couple of projects that are not directly related to that as well. Hoepfully I can share more about that later.
