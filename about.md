I am Erik Hellman, a software developer with 20 years' of experience, and 8 years' of experience of Android development.
I run Hellman Software AB, a software development consultancy where I focus on Android, Internet-of/Things and Cloud.

On this website you can find my blog on software development, which I hope will contain some useful tips of software
development for others working in this field.
